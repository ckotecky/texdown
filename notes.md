problems:
sigma / sum
	- underscore after makes sum
	- what if we want π/Σ with a subscript?
		+ can switch subscript and superscript order and keep one empty?

{} will be brackets or cases
() will be semantic (subscripts, superscripts)
	sometimes we want to keep the brackets in the superscript (derivatives)
underscore, overscore, hat, tilde, vector

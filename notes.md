problems:
sigma / sum
	- underscore after makes sum
	- what if we want π/Σ with a subscript?
		+ can switch subscript and superscript order and keep one empty?

underscore, overscore, hat, tilde, vector

proofs and other begin/end sections



# objects:
- section
	+ *end* 
		- different section of same or lower level
- list
	+ *end*
		- different list of lower or same level
		- section of any level
	
	+ list entry
- table
	+ row
	+ row delimiter
	+ column delimiter?
- text
	+ text block
	+ math block




# line beginnings:
- (!) specifies title level by count
- (-) specifies list entry
	- can be indented for list nesting
- (>) or (<) or (><) specify justification
- (%) specifies comments


# match block processing:
- shown in italics
- `` delimits a math block
- {} will be brackets or cases
- () will be semantic (subscripts, superscripts)
	- sometimes we want to keep the brackets in the superscript (derivatives)
